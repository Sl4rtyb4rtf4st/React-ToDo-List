# React Man

## Createing a react component:

You can start a create a react component in two ways:
1. the regular way by using, class ComponentName extends React.Component{}
2. Or using a stateless functional component, no class no extends, no "this" mess or need for a constructor or workaround or return: const ComponentName = ({someText}) => {};

The end is always the same: export default ComponentName;
